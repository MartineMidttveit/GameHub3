This is the first project we made at Noroff, and its supposed to be a website for a company selling online video games. This project have been altered in several task, as described in "Description". 
Throughout this project, I learned the basics of UX / UI design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also got insight in using a CMS. 

## DESCRIPTION
- The first task in this project was to make the design in Figma. 
- The second task was to code it only using HTML and CSS. 
- The third task was to implement JavaScript and fetch elements from an external API. 

During the first semester we learned a lot about UX and UI design, that I wanted to implement in my project. Therefore, during the summerbreak, I decided to upgrade the design a bit.
